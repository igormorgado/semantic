Job description

Quickly maturing startup seeking like minded Python Engineer! PacketFabric redefines how companies procure, consume, and manage their network connectivity. The technical team is a small, talented, and close knit group and we need a team member to help us accomplish our goal of making the best darn carrier network on the planet.


As a well rounded software engineer, you should definitely be the type that appreciates diversity in your day, and challenges outside of your comfort level! A typical day in the life of a PacketFabric software engineer might include these types of activities:

Designing a deterministic lifecycle workflow for our next product offering.
Writing core platform code for a new feature, and unit tests for functionality.
Leading discussions on new development and gathering requirements from business users for new features.
Refactoring and improving existing code for performance and simplicity. For example, breaking a large method into smaller, more maintainable and easily tested methods.
Build tools to help our internal business partners better perform their jobs
Researching additional ideas, you may have to improve the product/platform overall and sharing with the team.
Interacting with customers and/or sales on a bug in the software, quickly resolving it, and coordinating across the team to push a fix.
Working with other engineers and discussing quirks in network protocols and network interconnection which translate rapid API changes.
